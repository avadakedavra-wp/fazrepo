## Commands

### `fazrepo check`

Check versions of all installed package managers.

**Options:**
- `-d, --detailed`: Show detailed information including installation paths
- `-o, --only <managers>`: Only check specific package managers (comma-separated)

**Examples:**
```bash
# Check all managers
fazrepo check

# Check with detailed info
fazrepo check --detailed

# Check only npm and yarn
fazrepo check --only npm,yarn
```

### `fazrepo list`

List all supported package managers with descriptions.

### `fazrepo version`

Show version information.

### `fazrepo init`

Initialize fazrepo in the current directory (creates a `.fazrepo` config file).

## Output Examples

### Standard Output
```
🔍 Checking package manager versions...

✅ npm 9.8.1 (/usr/local/bin/npm)
✅ yarn 1.22.19 (/usr/local/bin/yarn)
❌ pnpm not installed
✅ bun 1.0.35 (/usr/local/bin/bun)
```

### Detailed Output
```
🔍 Checking package manager versions...

✅ npm 9.8.1
   📍 Path: /usr/local/bin/npm
✅ yarn 1.22.19
   📍 Path: /usr/local/bin/yarn
❌ pnpm not installed
✅ bun 1.0.35
   📍 Path: /usr/local/bin/bun
```

## Configuration

FazRepo can be initialized in a project directory to create a configuration file:

```bash
fazrepo init
```

This creates a `.fazrepo` file with basic configuration.

## Troubleshooting

### Command Not Found
If you get a "command not found" error after installation:

1. Make sure the binary is in your PATH
2. Try restarting your terminal
3. For Cargo installations, ensure `~/.cargo/bin` is in your PATH

### Version Check Fails
If version checking fails for a specific package manager:

1. Verify the package manager is properly installed
2. Try running the package manager's version command manually
3. Check if the binary is accessible from your PATH
